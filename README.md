# Hello, I'm Jo√£o! üëã  

## About Me  
üëã Hi! I'm a **Software Engineering** student with a strong passion for leveraging technology to solve complex problems. My primary focus is on enhancing my expertise in **Java**, particularly with the **Spring Boot** framework, and working with both **SQL** and **NoSQL** databases. I also have experience in front-end development using **Angular**, which allows me to build dynamic and responsive web applications.

I bring hands-on experience in **Java**, **Python**, **C#**, and **Web Development**, with a solid foundation in basic Python and C# programming. I thrive on building efficient, scalable, and innovative solutions, and I'm constantly expanding my skill set to tackle challenging projects. Feel free to explore my personal projects to see how I apply my knowledge and creativity to real-world problems!

Let‚Äôs connect and create something amazing together! üöÄ
